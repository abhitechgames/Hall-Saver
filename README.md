# Hall-Saver
Welcome to the thrilling world of "Hall Saver," where your strategic prowess and quick thinking are the only things standing between a horde of relentless zombies and the destruction of a central hall. In this heart-pounding tower defense game, your mission is to fend off wave after wave of undead attackers by strategically placing an arsenal of powerful weapons and defenses.

# Gameplay:
The Central Hall: At the heart of the action stands the Central Hall, your last bastion of safety. Your primary objective is to protect this critical structure from the impending zombie onslaught.
The Arsenal: "Hall Saver" provides you with a wide array of defensive weapons and tools to combat the zombie menace. These include cannons, crossbows, double cannons, and mortars, each with its unique strengths and abilities. It's up to you to decide which combination of defenses will work best against each wave of zombies.
Zombie Waves: Brace yourself for increasingly challenging waves of zombies, each more formidable than the last. Zombies may vary in size, strength, and speed, so you'll need to adapt your defensive strategy accordingly.

#Note:
This game is made for SonderingEmily x Juliestrator Jam (48 Hours Game Jam), Unfortunately, I'm not able to complete it before the deadline due to some fu*king eye allergy that just happened on the final day of the jam (Day 2).
I made it an Open-Source Project, You can find it on my GitHub profile: https://github.com/abhitechgames, (since it is a game jam project there are a lot of bugs and crap code)
